---++ Syntax Rules

%ATTAC%NOP%HMENT{ name="filename" topic="TopicName" web="Webname" label="sometimes_text_sometimes_magic" }%

This apparently trivial plugin turns out to be quite useful. Besides syntactic sugar, it actually makes previously hard things easier!

Until now, referencing an attachment in a TWiki topic has required escape to HTML, with lots of ugly TWiki variables like %PUBU%NOP%RLPATH% and %ATT%NOP%ACHURL% to do the simplest things. AttachLinkPlugin fixes that!

Further, it makes it easy to have clickable images - for example, thumbnails that when clicked, expand to a full-size picture.

Here are the syntax details:
   * name - The filename that you upload. Just the name, no path. The name= is optional, but the quotes are not.
   * topic - the topic that manages the attachment. The default is the current topic, so you can usually omit this.
   * web - the web that contains the topic that manages the attachment. The default is the current web, so again, you can usually omit this.
   * label - the thing that you want visible to represent the link. This can be text - or another object. The default is the filename, so you can omit it too. See the examples for details.
---++ Examples

%ATT%NOP%ACHMENT{ "foo.jpg" }% Create a link to foo.jpg in the current topic, which will look like: %BLUE%foo.jpg %ENDCOLOR%underlined. (Can WYSIWYG underline?)

%ATTA%NOP%CHMENT{ "foo.jpg" label="The foomobile afloat" }% gives you a hyperlink to the same file, like this: %BLUE%The foomobile afloat%ENDCOLOR%

%ATTA%NOP%CHMENT{ "foo.jpg" label="%IM%NOP%G{ "foo_thumb.jpg" align="left" width="40" class="none" }%}% will display foo_thumb.jpg inline. You can click on the image, and if you do, foo.jpg will display.

So you essentially have the power of ![[WikiWord][PrettyText]] links, for images and other attachments. And anything else that will take an HTML anchor tag.

A rather surprising result for less than 10 executable statements of perl. If %A%NOP%TT% is not in use (do we have a registry of variables?), I would be receptive to adding the line to add it as an alias for %ATTA%NOP%CHMENT% - I already have 10s of thousands of instances of %ATTA%NOP%CHMENT%

Enjoy it as much as I do.
